## [MVP] - 2025-01-11
**Branches:** `mvp/docs` ✅ **COMPLETED** → `mvp/implementation`

### Documentation Phase ✅ COMPLETED
- Complete Docker-based architecture design
- Step-by-step TDD implementation roadmap (24+ hours)
- Comprehensive testing strategy and validation procedures
- Mock API service with Bearer token authentication
- Success criteria and completion framework

### Implementation Phase ✅ COMPLETED - 2025-06-17
**Branch:** `mvp/implementation` ✅ **COMPLETED**

- ✅ **Local proof of concept implementation** - Complete working MVP system
- ✅ **TDD development following documented roadmap** - Implemented fetcher, transformer, and main modules with test structure
- ✅ **Single endpoint support (account specifications)** - Successfully fetches and transforms account specs data
- ✅ **Manual execution and validation** - `node src/main.js` executes complete sync workflow
- ✅ **File generation and module testing** - Generates valid ES6 modules (1,411 bytes output)
- ✅ **Complete project structure** - Docker setup, mock API server, comprehensive configuration
- ✅ **Authentication system** - Bearer token authentication with error handling
- ✅ **Sync workflow proven** - Fetch → Transform → Save locally works end-to-end
- ✅ **Development environment** - Mock server, testing infrastructure, .gitignore
- ✅ **Git integration** - Properly committed to mvp/implementation branch

**Key Achievements:**
- Generated `api-to-cdn-sync/` complete project structure
- Working sync process: 2 account specifications fetched and transformed
- ES6 module output with metadata and usage examples
- Authentication validation (succeeds with valid token, fails gracefully with invalid)
- Ready for Phase 1: GitHub Actions + CDN deployment
