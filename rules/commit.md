## Commit Strategy

- Feature-based commits only: Commit when a complete, self-contained feature is ready, not for individual file changes
- One feature per commit: Each commit should represent a single, cohesive feature or functionality
- Functional state: Every commit must leave the codebase in a working, testable state

## Commit Message Format

```
feat: [Brief feature description]

## Feature Description
[Detailed explanation of what the feature does and why it was needed]

## Prompt History
[Include the key prompts/conversations that led to this implementation]
